    "- **What are the best cases for using violin?**\n",
    "    - You usually want to use a violin plot if you have a categorical/ordinal feature vs. a continuous feature and the categorical/ordinal feature has maybe more than 3-4 categories so overlapping histograms won't work.\n",
    "- **\"There is no objective ground truth for several types of vars, I think that might be something more I would have to think about when trying to tell a story!**\n",
    "    - While that's certianly true sometimes, it's usually not too difficult to decide the type of a variable.\n",
    "    - If you are in doubt, try both data types in your ML pipeline and check if it has impact on the performance of your ML model\n",
    "- **Too many parameters can be played with in the plot function!**\n",
    "    - YES! And I only had time to show what I believe are the most imnportant ones!\n",
    "    - Please read the manual to see all the parameters.\n",
    "    - Your figure quality will greatly improve if you are aware and use the functionalities and you are intentional when you prepare figures\n",
    "- **Both the box plot and the violin plot are used to visualize categorical v.s. continuous variables, so what should we consider while choosing one of these two types of plots (what is the tradeoff of picking one over the other)?**\n",
    "    - Preparing visualizations can be subjective. In this case, I'd say that either a box and a violin plot works well, it's up to you to decide which one you like more.\n",
    "- **I have not used violin plots in other courses, so I am curious about what purpose they hold and when is most appropriate to use.**\n",
    "    - They are a good alternative for box plots if you want to see the histogram of the continuous feature.\n",
    "- **I found continuous vs categorical and categorical vs continuous use different visualization, so how do we decided if it is cont vs cate or cate vs cont given two features?**\n",
    "    - Nope, check the 2x2 matrix again.\n",
    "    - The same figures should be used for either, the order of the features don't matter.\n",
    "- **Are we supposed to memorize all specific implementations of the visualizing tools?**\n",
    "    - The syntax, no. You can always look up the manual.\n",
    "    - The visualization types, when to use them, when to use e.g., log axes, etc, that's what you need to know.\n",
    "- **how to determine the appropriate number of bins.**\n",
    "    - That's dataset specific so just experiment with a few values and see what's best.\n",
    "- **Was a bit overwhelmed by content - would like more practice with guided creation of plts.**\n",
    "    - You'll practice it in PS3. "

    "**0. Data collection/manipulation**: you might have multiple data sources and/or you might have more data than you need\n",
    "   - you need to be able to read in datasets from various sources (like csv, excel, SQL, parquet, etc)\n",
    "   - you need to be able to filter the columns/rows you need for your ML model\n",
    "   - you need to be able to combine the datasets into one dataframe \n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: you need to understand your data and verify that it doesn't contain errors\n",
    "   - do as much EDA as you can!\n",
    "    \n",
    "<span style=\"background-color: #FFFF00\">**2. Split the data into different sets**: most often the sets are train, validation, and test (or holdout)</span>\n",
    "   - practitioners often make errors in this step!\n",
    "   - you can split the data randomly, based on groups, based on time, or any other non-standard way if necessary to answer your ML question\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Preprocess the data**: ML models only work if X and Y are numbers! Some ML models additionally require each feature to have 0 mean and 1 standard deviation (standardized features)\n",
    "   - often the original features you get contain strings (for example a gender feature would contain 'male', 'female', 'non-binary', 'unknown') which needs to be transformed into numbers\n",
    "   - often the features are not standardized (e.g., age is between 0 and 100) but it needs to be standardized\n",
    "    \n",
    "**4. Choose an evaluation metric**: depends on the priorities of the stakeholders\n",
    "   - often requires quite a bit of thinking and ethical considerations\n",
    "     \n",
    "**5. Choose one or more ML techniques**: it is highly recommended that you try multiple models\n",
    "   - start with simple models like linear or logistic regression\n",
    "   - try also more complex models like nearest neighbors, support vector machines, random forest, etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**6. Tune the hyperparameters of your ML models (aka cross-validation or hyperparameter tuning)**\n",
    "   - ML techniques have hyperparameters that you need to optimize to achieve best performance\n",
    "   - for each ML model, decide which parameters to tune and what values to try\n",
    "   - loop through each parameter combination\n",
    "       - train one model for each parameter combination\n",
    "       - evaluate how well the model performs on the validation set\n",
    "   - take the parameter combo that gives the best validation score\n",
    "   - evaluate that model on the test set to report how well the model is expected to perform on previously unseen data\n",
    "    \n",
    "**7. Interpret your model**: black boxes are often not useful\n",
    "   - check if your model uses features that make sense (excellent tool for debugging)\n",
    "   - often model predictions are not enough, you need to be able to explain how the model arrived to a particular prediction (e.g., in health care)"
